### Möglicher Aufbau

Aufbau:
	- Bilderauswahl
	- Nacheinander [[Englisch Mündliche Prüfung#Bildbeschreibung]]
	- Discusion [[Englisch Mündliche Prüfung#Discusion]]


### Bildbeschreibung
There are different types of visuals: photos, posters, paintings, drawings or sketches. Often
they are combined with a written text, either as a title or a caption.

Step 1
	Basic information/Introduction
	-  What is your first impression of the visual?
	- Read the title or caption. What is the general topic?
	- When and where was the visual created or published?

Step 2
	Description
	Choose one of these approaches.
	- Start with the main subject, i.e.a dominant object, describe it in detail, then describe the
	background (useful for a visual with one dominant image).
	or
	- Start at the left of the visual and work across to the right or vice versa (useful for pictures
	with a lot of activity).
	or
	- Start at the top of the visual and work down to the bottom or vice versa (useful for visuals
	where the interest tails off towards the top or bottom).

Step 3
	Analysis/Interpretation
	- Draw conclusions about what the visual is meant to convey and how it achieves its effect. You might consider:
	- the technique, colours
	- the effect on the viewer
	- who is addressed and why
	- the artist's/photographer's message

Step 4
	Evaluation
	Evaluate the image by thinking about the following questions:
	- How effective is the image as a visual message?
	-  Can the visual be looked at in different ways?
	- How does it compare/contrast to other examples that you know?
	- If the image illustrates a text, to what extent does the image support, complement or
	contradict the text?
	- If you are asked, say whether you like the image or not and why.



### Discusion
Möglichkeiten:

[[Au pair]]: Vorschlag [[Johann]] Reihenfolge: saufen-> au pair
	- An Au Pair is someone who supports a Family with childcare and chores. In that time you can live there for free and get food and pocket money. For example you play with the kids, bring them to school, do they're laundry and prepare they're meals. The year is not only for childcare, it's also to discover the language and culture from the country you stay in. You can work as an Au Pair in many countries , the most popular countries are the USA, Australia, UK, New Zealand and Europe.
	Qualifications:
	- First you need to choose an organization, because every Organization has different Qualifications you need. You need to be between 18 and 26 years old You must have babysitting experience, sometimes more than 200 hours. You must also have graduated from secondary school.
	  Another qualification is, that you need to be proficient in English. You also need a drivers license. If you go to the USA, the organization needs a criminal background check. You also have to had a personal interview with the organization and your future host family to get to know you. And you need a Health Check before you go.
	==he title comes from the French term au pair, meaning **"at par" or "equal to"**, indicating that the relationship is intended to be one of equals: the au pair is intended to become a member of the family, albeit a temporary one, rather than a traditional domestic worker.
