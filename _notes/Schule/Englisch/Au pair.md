definition/task: a young foreign person, who helps with housework or childcare in exchange for food, a room, and some pocket money
meaning: The title comes from the French term au pair, meaning **"at par" or "equal to"**, indicating that the relationship is intended to be one of equals: the au pair is intended to become a member of the family, albeit a temporary one, rather than a traditional domestic worker.

opinion: 
Now we want to discuss wether or not an au pair year is a waste of time.
On the one hand being an au pair has a lot of advantages e.g. learning the language and culture. Furthermore you get a little bit of pocket money and meet new people. In addition you mature, because you need to take care of little children. ^cbbbe8
